Eric Mrak's (neo)vim configuration
==================================

This configuration assumes you are using [Neovim](https://neovim.io/), but
should work with Vim, too.

```
mkdir -p ~/.config
git clone https://github.com/mrak/dotfiles.vim ~/.config/nvim
```

`init.vim` is the entrypoint and configures plugins using
[vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug).

Includes my personal `mrak` colorscheme derived from the base16 family.

See the included `mrak.txt` doc for more information.
