Eric Mrak's (neo)vim configuration
==================================

This configuration assumes you are using [Neovim](https://neovim.io/).

```
mkdir -p ~/.config
git clone https://github.com/mrak/mrak.vim ~/.config/nvim
```

`init.vim` is the entrypoint and configures plugins using
[vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug).

Includes my personal `mrak` colorscheme. It is derived from the base16 family
and is a dark theme.
